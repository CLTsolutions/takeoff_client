## Deployed Project:
The final version deployed to heroku can be found at https://clt-takeofftravelapp.herokuapp.com/.

## About Takeoff
This is the client side of a PERN stack full CRUD [traveler's app](https://github.com/CLTsolutions/takeoff_client) in which users can track trips they have taken and blog about their experiences.

#### Made and Styled with:
* React (using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
* Tailwind CSS
* Ant Design
* Reactstrap

## Project Requirements:
The server portion of my app can be found [here](https://github.com/CLTsolutions/takeoff_server). This project was completed during my final badge of Eleven Fifty Academy's six month web development cohort. It demonstrations my culmination of skills and understanding of the following:

- React Legacy (Class Components, Lifecycle methods, State Management, etc.)
- React Styling Libraries
- Data persistence utilizing PostgreSQL and a NodeJS ORM library (Sequelize)
- DB Associations
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on at least two items separate from auth (users)
- Deployment through Heroku
- User registration and authentication (REST-ful API)
- Role Based Access Control
- Strong Typing with TypeScript (meaning minimal use of the type “any”)
- Connecting Server and Client
